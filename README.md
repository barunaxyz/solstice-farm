## 🎮 About the Game

It's the **Summer Solstice** — the longest day of the year. You've inherited an old farm from your grandfather, and you have one extraordinary, sun-drenched day to bring it back to life.

Plant seeds, till the soil, water your crops, and harvest them before the solstice sun sets. Sell your harvest at the shop to buy better seeds. Every second of sunlight counts — crops grow fastest at midday when the sun is at its peak!

## 🌍 Theme Connection

The game is directly inspired by the **June Solstice** — the moment when the sun reaches its highest point and the day is at its longest. The core mechanic revolves around this: **crops grow faster when the sun is at its peak**, creating a natural rhythm of urgency and reward tied to the solstice day cycle.
